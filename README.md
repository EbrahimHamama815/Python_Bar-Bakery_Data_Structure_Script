# Bar-Bakery_Data_Structure_Script

In this project, we are dealing with special data. It is a meneu for a Bar/Bakery bussiness, but what is special a bout it is the formatting. 

The workbook consists of multiple sheets (categories), each sheet contains multiple seperate tables for each product calculating the cost for ingredients and the final product selling price, as per below image:

So, to handle this type of formatting, we will need something powerfull like python loops and utilize pandas functions to transform this into a long tabular format that is easy tow work with, with visualization tools like Power BI or even Excel. Here is an example of the final result:
